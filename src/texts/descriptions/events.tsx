    Raffles Hall held the very first Inter-Hall Hackathon, in collaboration with King-Edward VII hall, Eusoff hall and
    Kent Ridge Hall.
    <br />
    <br />
    The Inter-Hall Hackathon is held to foster healthy competitions, learning and relationships amongst developers of
    different halls.
    <br />
    <br />
    The participants had the following prompt. They could work in a group of up to 4 members, to create the
    minimum-viable product of the solutions. Participants also had to present their ideas to the judges on the last day
    of the Hackathon.

    The culmination of half a year of hard work, the first large scale software project among NUS halls finally exited
    Beta and opened up for all residents. This project aims to resolve many common issues faced by our hall residents
    including booking of facilities, collating of supper orders and more.
    <br />
    <br />
    Apart from the convenience that our flagship application provides, it also serves a beacon of inspiration. This
    application proves that training developers and designers from scratch, then coordinating development efforts is
    possible, while gruelling and tedious. To find out more, click on our projects tab!
